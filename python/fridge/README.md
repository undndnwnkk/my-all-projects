This is my first python project!

- This is just mini-structure, idea of this: we have a fridge and we can:

1. add(). We adding new good to our fridge, which contains name of this good, amount and expiration date
2. add_by_note(). Working like add() but with another input type
3. find(). We can find all goods with some name
4. amount(). Counting amount of all goods by some string, we search this goods by using function find()
5. expire(). Count timedelta of today's date and expiration date
