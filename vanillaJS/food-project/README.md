# Food project in Vanilla JS

## This site implements the following functionality:
1) The whole site is written with js modules, so as not to put all the functionality in one file and it was convenient to use the functions
2) Pop-up window like registration is realized. The data specified by the user is written to local Storage
3) Implemented two sliders: In the welcome block and the block below.
4) Logic for calorie calculation is implemented, i.e. the user fills in the form and the program calculates the necessary diet depending on his data (height, weight, gender, etc.).
